To write a post, create a haml file in posts/, then regenerate the index:
  echo "Post Content" > posts/2012-04-30-time-to-start-a-new-blog.haml
  coffee build.coffee

To regenerate the post index, do:
  npm install
  coffee build.coffee

To rebuild the layout assets (less/haml/coffescripts), do:
  npm install --dev
  coffee build.coffee -a
