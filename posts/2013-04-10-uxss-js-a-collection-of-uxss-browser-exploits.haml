%h2 uxss.js: a library of UXSS exploits
article
  :markdown
    In order to promote awareness of the dangers of browser UXSS vulnerabilities, I have started a framework for exploiting these vulns. Current supported browser versions include:
    
    - Chrome 21 and below
    - Firefox 16 and below
    - Safari 6 and below
    
    Usage:
    
    `uxss.runInContext("google.com", function(){alert(document.domain)})`
    
    Depending on your browser, you should either see "google.com" in a popup, or the uxss library will fail silently.
    
    Enjoy, and submit PRs! :)
